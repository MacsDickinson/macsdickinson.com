title: The end of 30 goals for 2013

2013 has been a very productive year. It&#39;s seen a new job, a house move, the birth of this blog, a couple of talks, the loss of a laptop and a couple of conferences. Not all of these were foreseen but a number of them were down to [the goals I set myself at the beginning of the year][0]. I haven&#39;t completed everything I set out to do but I do think that giving myself these clear objectives has pushed me to get more out of 2013 than I otherwise would have done. Being self motivated isn&#39;t only important for the self employed, it&#39;s also important to motivate yourself outside of work if you want to improve. Giving yourself a clear set of goals to complete in a set time is a guaranteed way to squeeze more out of your year. Here&#39;s how I got on:

<!--excerpt-->

Completed
---------

* **Enrol in a technical course** - I have started (but never got around to finishing) the [HTML5 Game Development][1] course with [Udacity][2]. It is actually  fantastic course and I highly recommended it for anyone who wants to improve their vanilla javascript skills.
* **Eat something I've never eaten before** - This will have been completed on numerous occasions. I officially crossed it off the list after eating a treat a colleague brought back from India.
* **1 month without alcohol** - January was totally dry and it was great. This is something I am going to try to do more often.
* **Attend a technical user group** - I went along to [Leeds Sharp][3] in January and have been going since.
* **3 months without XBox** - This felt more difficult than the dry month at the time but I've probably done another two months without it since.
* **Brew my own beer** - Brewed a bitter for April and have the kit now to make a pilsner and a stout.
![The brewing process ][6]
* **Write a portfolio website and blog** - This is it. I've actually removed the portfolio part whilst I polish of a number of my projects. It will be back soon.
* **Write a Google Chrome plugin and get it submitted to the chrome web store** - I published SecurePass (now re-branded as [Uniquify.it][4]) however I have a number of breaking changes that I want to make before re-releasing it to the general public.
* **Visit a foreign country** - You can't get more foreign than Disney Land
![Magic Kingdom][5]
* **Pass a Microsoft exam** - I am official a Microsoft Certified Technical Specialist in Web Application Development in .NET 4 ([70-515][7]). I actually quite enjoyed the process of taking the exam so I will look to become an MCPD or MCSD in 2014.
* **Climb to the top of a UK mountain** - Climbed to the top of Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons, on 13th July. 
![Pen-Y-Fan][9]
* **Contribute to an open source project** - I have a few open source projects of my own that I regularly contribute to such as [ASafaHarbor][10] and [Uniquify.it][11] but it's my [contribution to Sandra.Snow][12] that counts for this one. I am planning on contributing significantly more to the community in 2014.
* **Raise money for charity** - November was Movember and I raised [the lofty sum of £35][13]. Our team did much better, pulling together [£400 between us][14].
* **Give a talk at a technical meet up** - In November I gave a talk on [Event Store][15] at [Leeds Sharp][16].
![You can also see the mo in this picture][22]
This was great fun and fantastic motivation to learn something new. Giving more talks will definitely be a focus for 2014.
* **Find a diet that doesn't give me acid heartburn** - I haven't really found a diet that works but I have found prescription drugs. Yay!

Started
-------

* **Read a non technical book each quarter** - I'm not the fastest reader so this was always going to be a struggle. I have read **most of** The girl with the dragon tattoo and World War Z, both of which are good books but I've not hit the target of one each quarter.
* **Read a technical book each quarter** - As with the last one, this was going to be a struggle, especially when it turns out that I read the vast majority of content online - not in books. That said I have read **most of** a number of technical books:
    - [Pragmatic Programmer][17]
    - [CQRS The Example][18]
    - [Instant Nancy Web Development][19]
* **Write a blog post each month** - Since this blog went live in March I have posted 14 articles so in some ways this has been completed.

Maybe Next Year
---------------

* **Write an android app and get it submitted to Google play**
* **Write a Windows 8 app and get it submitted to the windows app store**
* **Write an IOS app and get it submitted to the apple app store** - I had this grand plan to create a fantastic app using PhoneGap and deploy it to all the stores. How misguided I was. I have been much more focussed on web technologies than I have been with native apps. It'll never catch on anyway.
* **Go to the gym regularly** - As so many others I started the year with healthy expectations but life takes over. I kept it up for a good few months but I've not set foot inside a gym since June.
* **Finish a marathon** - I started training, I even ran 10k on the treadmill but this goal was probably a little overambitious. I think I'll reign it in a little for next year an try to do a half marathon.
* **Make my own cheese** - I got a cheese making kit for Christmas so this one will only just miss out on being part of 2013.
* **Spend a week with my mum and dad** - I managed four days in July and three over Christmas so technically it was a week but the point of this goal was for me to see them more than usual - which I haven't.
* **Go to a comedy show**
* **Go to the theatre**
* **Go to a festival**
* **See an established band I've never seen before** - I'm really disappointed that I didn't get around to doing these. They will have to be pushed over to next year.
* **Learn a new programming language** - I started learning Node but someone rightly pointed out that it is a framework, not a language. In fact I have spent a lot of time in 2013 playing with frameworks. Perhaps I need to move away from the .Net safety wheels.

That's 15 done, 3 started and 12 missed out on. I'm really pleased with what I've achieved in 2013 but I do think I could have spent more time one the non-technical things in my life. Setting these goals has definitely been a success, so much so the idea [appears to be spreading ][20], so I will be doing something [similar for 2014][21] although I will be cutting down the number of goals to something a little more manageable.
