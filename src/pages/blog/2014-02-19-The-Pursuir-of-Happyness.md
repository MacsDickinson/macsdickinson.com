For me coding is more than a job, it's my hobby. It's what I get excited about, what I agonise over and what I do to wind down. I do a lot of coding in my spare time but this pails in comparison to the code that's written during working hours - so when I made the decision to move jobs it was a big deal. The place that I worked was great - I enjoyed the work and the people - so I wasn't looking for anything new when the opportunity came about. As developers we get spammed by recruiters on a daily basis so we're used to turning a blind eye. But one job caught my attention. It seemed to be exactly what I needed. The recruiter spoke about how innovation reigned, how I'd be working on clients like Google and how I'd be mentoring globally distributed teams - so I went for it. Boy did I have the wool pulled over my eyes!

Going from a company that pushes it's employees to perform at their best to one that has a culture that stifles creativity is a depressing move. Especially when expectations were set so high. This experience has been a pretty steep learning curve for me. It's not been particularly pleasant but it's been valuable nonetheless. At the beginning of my career I saw interviews as a one way thing. I wanted the job and I needed to persuade them I was worth the chance. This job was the first where they where they also needed to convince me and it's safe to say that I was inexperienced in what to look for. I thought I was thorough enough with the questions I asked but when I think back I was taking their word for it. I had no assurances and there was no substance to what was being said. I have since had some great advice from some great people.

* Coding is a hobby, not a chore
* Perils of chasing the money
* Interviews are two way
* Things to look out for in interviews
