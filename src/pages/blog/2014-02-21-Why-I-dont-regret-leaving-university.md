![I Regret Nothing ][0]

I didn't do too well at university. For some reason I decided it was a good idea to take a music course that was mostly theory. I'm a drummer - theory isn't my strong point.

I grew up in rural Wales - [Brecon][1] - where computer science isn't at the forefront of peoples minds. The local high school only offered the traditional subjects (I opted for Maths, Chemistry and Music) and for the more adventurous there was a local collage offering a BTec in masonry - amongst other things.

<!--excerpt-->

It wasn't until I left Brecon that I really started to get to know the true magnitude of the options that were available to me and after a painful year of music theory I decided to call it a day. In hindsight this is when I should have signed up for a CS degree but 19 year old Macs wasn't particularly forward thinking. Instead I did what any self respecting drop out would have done - I got a job in a call centre. One thing led to another and a year or so later I was in a semi-technical file processing role at a translation company. This was as dull as it sounds but it taught me a number of valuable things:

* RegEx - whether this is a blessing or a hindrance I am yet to find out but for over a year I RegExed the crap out of those files.
* C# - There is only so far you can go with a find and replace. [My boss at the time][2] had introduced me to [LinqPad][3] so I went out and got myself a [C# book][4].
* PM's - We tend to focus our efforts on getting to know frameworks and languages we use but what use is all this if we cannot project that knowledge onto someone who doesn't already know it?

The next thing I know I've been promoted and I'm writing C# code for a living! Fast forward another year and I'm a full blown Software Developer!

This is all very interesting but what's my point?
-------------------------------------------------

Since then I have always felt somewhat lacking compared to my honoured peers and have felt the need to overcompensate for my lack of education. It is this underlying insecurity that I'll be called out as [a phony][6] that makes me to consistently push myself to the limit. This is why I blog, give talks, contribute to OSS and do my own projects. I was to put myself out there to get whatever feedback I can. I've not had the same level of feedback that my educated counterparts have so I feel I may be less sure of myself.

I'm interested to see what other people in the industry think to this - especially those who do have degrees and see it from the other side.

* How important is your CS degree in the job your in now?
* Do you find you also get [Impostor Syndrome][5]?
* Do you think there is a clear distinction between educated and the self taught developers and what are the pro's and con's?
